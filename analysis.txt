After running my program for 60 minutes, I was able to see how the api changes every minute. I saw that as the minutes would go up that the factor would also increase. After taking a much closer look and looking at the smaller factors such as 1, 8, and 27. I was able to realize that the factors were a cube of the current minute. I also realized when comparing the factor to pi, that pi would get more precise as the factor got greater.
